Manchu script is used to write Manchu and Sibe languages. Although it is
included in Unicode, it is still difficult to render correctly. The first
difficulty is that the Manchu script is written vertically, and unlike Chinese
or Japanese, the left line comes first. Another difficulty is that Manchu
alphabets have initial, medial and final forms. Ligature handling is also
required.

This is a Graphite-enabled version of Manchu/Sibe fonts originally available
from daicing.com. The OpenType fonts from daicing.com work well on Windows 7,
but unfortunately not on Linux. Adding Graphite tables is one solution which
gives the capability of intelligent contextual glyph/ligature handling for the
various scripts.
